# Some assorted tasks for SilverStripe CMS #

Under development...

Tasks are designed for nix platforms, they might not (all) work on Windows.

## Requirements ##

 * SilverStripe Framework 3.1+ and CMS 3.1+

## Installation ##

Copy the module to the root of your website and do a /dev/build/?flush=1. You
can now find the tasks in the Taskmanager:

 * yoursite.com/dev/tasks/

## Tasks ##

### ResetCacheTask ###

Simple task to reset the SilverStripe cache on hosting platforms where the 
cached files are owned by the webserver so you cannot remove them by hand. 
You can either:

 * ?mode=all: clear the entire SilverStripe cache
 * ?mode=partial: only remove partial cache files generated by the website
